  I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). 
  I received my Master's degree in Computer Technology from Dalian University of Technology (DLUT) in 2023 and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology (with a focus on Japanese) from DLUT in 2020. 
  My research primarily focuses on multimodal sensing and embodied intelligence.
