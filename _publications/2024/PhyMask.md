#     This paper introduces PhyMask, an adaptive masking paradigm designed to enhance the efficiency and interpretability of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) in analyzing IoT sensing signals. Unlike mainstream MAEs that rely on random masking techniques, PhyMask employs an adaptive masking strategy aligned with critical signal information. Its main contributions are threefold. First, PhyMask leverages the energy significance of frequency components to prioritize information-rich time-frequency regions, improving the reconstruction of original signals. Second, it includes a coherence-based masking component to identify and preserve essential temporal dynamics within the data. Finally, PhyMask integrates these components into an adaptive masking paradigm tailored to optimize the sensing context awareness within the masking configuration, focusing on the most informative parts of the data. This approach leads to more efficient self-supervised learning and improved downstream task performance in IoT applications.
